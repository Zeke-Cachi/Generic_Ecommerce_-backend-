The backend was made with Node.js, with an emphasis in ES6 classes, loosely following the IoC design pattern. ItÂ´s a basic MVC with CRUD capabilities, with an app.ts to run the server and the database, a server.ts to start up the application and a route/controller for user-related and product-related logic.
